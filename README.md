# Zomato Smart Support 2.0 â€“ Product & RCA Case Study

This repository contains my end-to-end **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** and **Product Strategy Deck** projects based on real-world data from the Zomato app.  
It demonstrates how data-driven insights can be translated into actionable product proposals and experimentation plans.

##  Project Overview

- **Objective:** Identify top customer pain points from Zomatoâ€™s Play Store reviews and design a product solution to address the biggest issue â€“ Customer Support complaints.
- **Data Source:** 3,033 publicly available Zomato app reviews scraped from Google Play Store.
- **Approach:**
  1. Conducted RCA to uncover complaint trends, top categories, and root causes.
  2. Designed a product proposal â€“ **Smart Support 2.0**, an AI + Human hybrid support system.
  3. Created user personas, competitive benchmarking, KPIs, go-to-market strategy, and an A/B testing plan.
  4. Developed visuals (flow diagrams, KPI infographic, user personas) and compiled everything into a 12-slide product deck.
